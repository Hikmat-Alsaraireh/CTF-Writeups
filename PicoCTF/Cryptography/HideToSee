#### Description

How about some hide and seek heh?Look at this image [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/235/atbash.jpg).


solution:
Not the most enjoyable challenge. Gives us an image called `atbash.jpg`, but no ciphertext yet. We actually have to use steganography techniques to extract the ciphertext from being embedded in the image, using `steghide`:

Copy

```
$ steghide extract -sf atbash.jpg
```

The passphrase is empty. The `encrypted.txt` file that is created has the following:

Copy

```
krxlXGU{zgyzhs_xizxp_8z0uvwwx}
```

Based off the filename, we can assume it's an **atbash cipher**, which is essentially a transposition cipher where alphabet is flipped (so `A` goes to `Z`, `B` goes to `Y`, etc).
