#### Description

There is some interesting information hidden around this site. Can you find it?http://wily-courier.picoctf.net:50768/



solution:
Very nice indeed. We now have 3 parts of the flag: `picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c`. Now what was that hint in `robots.txt`?

### .htacess

```
# I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
```

An apache server! What kind of file could that be? Now... in order to be transparent, I had to take a hint here and for the following file from my friend [N1z0ku](https://github.com/N1z0ku). We now need to access the `.htaccess` file!

```
# Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
```

Our flag so far: `picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k`.

### .DS_Store

Now, you might be asking yourself: "What the hell? What kind of file is this?!". From what I've read, `.DS_Store` is a special MacOS file that stores information about the current folder. Like icon positioning etc. You may also see it if you unzip a file from a Mac user on a non-Mac computer. Kind of a token identifier of Mac computers.
