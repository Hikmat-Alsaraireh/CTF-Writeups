### Crack the Gate 2

Author: Yahaya Meddy

#### Description

The login system has been upgraded with a basic rate-limiting mechanism that locks out repeated failed attempts from the same source. We’ve received a tip that the system might still trust user-controlled headers. Your objective is to bypass the rate-limiting restriction and log in using the known email address: **ctf-player@picoctf.org** and uncover the hidden secret.The website is running [here](http://amiable-citadel.picoctf.net:53714/). Can you try to log in?.Download the passwords list [here](https://challenge-files.picoctf.net/c_amiable_citadel/0fa9993f68e218c88707174fa41fb468619f09b372ccc6a563cc3c3446dedba5/passwords.txt).



solution:
I solve the picoCTF “Crack the Gate 2” challenge by bypassing a rate-limit using the X-Forwarded-For header. The login form only allows one attempt per IP, returning an error after the first request. By capturing the request in Burp Suite and modifying the X-Forwarded-For value, the rate-limit resets every time. Then, using Intruder with pitchfork mode, I pair a password list with rotating header values and identify the valid response containing the flag. This video explains rate-limit logic, header trust issues, and how attackers can exploit misconfigured IP checks.
