#### Description

A university's online registration portal asks students to upload their ID cards for verification. The developer put some filters in place to ensure only image files are uploaded but are they enough? Take a look at how the upload is implemented. Maybe there's a way to slip past the checks and interact with the server in ways you shouldn't.

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.



solution:
I break down the picoCTF byp4ss3d "Bypassed" challenge and show how a vulnerable file-upload feature can be abused to execute code on the server and reveal the flag. The challenge looks simple on the surface—an upload form that only accepts images—but a hint about Apache behavior exposes a major weakness. By uploading both an .htaccess file that changes how Apache handles image files and a disguised “image” containing PHP code, it’s possible to trick the server into running commands through a .jpg file. Once both files are in place, accessing the uploaded image with a command parameter lets us read the hidden flag from the server.
