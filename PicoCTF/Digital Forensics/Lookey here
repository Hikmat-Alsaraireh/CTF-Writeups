#### Description

Attackers have hidden information in a very large mass of data in the past, maybe they are still doing it.Download the data [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/125/anthem.flag.txt).

solution:
We are also given the file [anthem.flag.txt](https://ctftime.org/writeup/files/anthem.flag.txt).

I viewed the contents of the file, which contained a very long text.

![Figure 1](https://ctftime.org/writeup/img/text.png)

I counted the words using,

`$ wc -w anthem.flag.txt`

Which showed that there was 19139 words.

![Figure 1](https://ctftime.org/writeup/img/word.png)

I know the flag format is `picoCTF{xxx}`, so I decided to grep it using,

`$ cat anthem.flag.txt | grep "picoCTF"`

Which revealed the flag.

Therefore, the flag is,

`picoCTF{gr3p_15_@w3s0m3_4554f5f5}`
